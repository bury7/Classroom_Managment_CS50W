# Classroom Managment 

Video overview: <https://youtu.be/7WJbSaupLiY>

This repository serves as my capstone project for the CS50W course. In this project, I created a site for managing students' distance learning. The site allows you to create teacher and student accounts, teachers can create and manage classes and assignments for them, and students can submit assignments and track their grades.

## Overview of the Course
This course equips me with the knowledge and practical skills required to build dynamic web applications using Python and JavaScript. Throughout the course, I explore web development fundamentals, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while delving into Python for backend development. I learn how to create server-side applications, work with databases, and use Python frameworks like Flask and Django. PraBy the course's end, I have a robust foundation in web development, Python, and JavaScript, prepared for careers in web development or related fields.


## Libraries used in the project
The following files are included in this repository:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): To implement all the functionality of the website;
  
- [Qrcode-generator](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator): To generate a QR code to join a class;


## Project Description

Upon visiting site, you are presented with two main options: creating a new account or logging in to an existing one. Once logged in, users can personalize their profiles with account information and add a profile photo. This site caters to two distinct user types: teachers and students.

### Teacher's Account

Teachers enjoy several powerful features:
- **Class Management:** They can create and edit classes.
- **QR Code Access:** Upon creating a class, teachers receive a unique QR code that allows easy sharing.
- **Class Customization:** Teachers can modify class details as needed.
- **Content Folders:** In each class, teachers can create two types of content folders:
  - **Materials:** Here, teachers can share valuable resources like lecture videos, textbooks, and more.
  - **Assignments:** This folder is dedicated to student tasks, where teachers can review and grade answers with optional comments.

### Student Account

Students have their own set of capabilities:
- **Join Classes:** They can join classes by using the unique links provided by teachers.
- **Access Learning Materials:** Students can access all educational materials shared by the teacher.
- **Submit Homework:** For assignments, students can submit their answers and receive feedback and grades from the teacher.
- **Grade Tracker:** Students can conveniently monitor their grades in their user profile.
